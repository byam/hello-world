# `go-restful`

A framework for REST API creation.

`go-restful` is a package for building REST-style web services in Go. 
REST, asks developers to follow a set of design protocols.

Using `go-restful`, we can separate the logic for API handlers and attach REST verbs. 
The benefit of this is that it clearly tells us by looking at the code what API we are creating.

## Install

* SQLite3
```bash
brew install sqlite3
```

* go-restful
```bash
go get github.com/emicklei/go-restful
```

## Roadmap

1. Design a REST API document.
2. Create models for a database.
3. Implement the API logic.
